	<h1>Balingasag is My Home</h1>
	<p>In the past, BALINGASAG was known as the "town that doesn't want to get bigger." It's an ancient town in the middle of Misamis Oriental, the largest and oldest municipality in the province. The name "Balingasag" comes from the Visayan words "baling kasag," which literally means "baling" or fish net and "kasag" which means crab. Originally, Balingasag was ruled by two powerful leaders, representing the Valmores and Madroño families. They decided to divide the town into two parts, with the Valmores settling in the north and the Madroños in the south. These leaders were considered the "Founding Patriarchs" of the municipality.</p>
