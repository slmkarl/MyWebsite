					<div class="name">St. Rita de Cascia Parish</div>
					<div class="des">First built by the Jesuits in 1892, the original structure of the church included a wooden upper story with two bell towers on each side.  In the aftermath of World War II, all that remained of the church was the lower story made of brick. When it was rebuilt, the second story was done away with entirely. During World War II, the guerrillas hastily burned the church because Japanese soldiers were stationed there. After the war, only the stone structure was left standing.<br><br>The church as it is today is a curious blend of old and new.  Its original outer brick walls still stand, but to its left is attached a bell tower and parish office of clearly recent vintage, veneered with ceramic tiles meant to match the brick walls of the old church. </div>
